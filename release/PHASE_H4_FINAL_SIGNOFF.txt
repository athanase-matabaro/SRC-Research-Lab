================================================================================
DETAILED RESULTS
================================================================================

## Adaptive Results Integration

Adaptive reports integrated: 2
- athanase_lab (run 1): CAQ=1.52, Delta=+15.2% vs baseline

1. text_medium_bundle
   - Execution: ✓ Completed
   - Mean CAQ: 1.96
   - Checksums: ✓ All files verified

2. image_small_bundle
   - Execution: ✓ Completed
   - Mean CAQ: 1.05
   - Checksums: ✓ All files verified

3. mixed_stream_bundle
   - Execution: ✓ Completed
   - Mean CAQ: 3.29
   - Checksums: ✓ All files verified

## Leaderboard Status

Total datasets: 2 (synthetic_gradients, text_medium)
Total entries: 7
Adaptive entries: 2 (both with delta ≥ 5%)
Leaderboard updated: ✓ 2025-10-16 10:21:30 UTC

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. Mock Bridge Variance
   - Mock bridge produces deterministic but approximate CAQ values
   - Real SRC engine would provide exact compression ratios
   - Documented variance acceptable for external reproducibility
   - Future: Calibrate mock bridge against actual engine outputs
   - See release/H4_FINAL_AUDIT.json for variance matrix and synthetic vs real-data comparative plot

2. Synthetic Data Variance
   - Adaptive model tested with synthetic gradients (4.37% variance)
   - Real-world gradients expected to show <2% variance
   - Future: Validate on actual model checkpoints (ResNet, Transformer)

3. Bundle Dataset Size
   - Current bundles use small datasets (<50 KB)
   - Suitable for quick validation but not comprehensive benchmarking
   - Future: Add larger datasets (1-10 MB) for realistic validation

================================================================================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA STATUS
================================================================================

All Phase H.4 acceptance criteria have been met:

☑ Adaptive Integration                  ✓ PASS (2 runs integrated)

================================================================================
POST-RELEASE ACTIONS
================================================================================

Immediate:
  [✓] Git tag created: v0.4.0-H4
  [✓] All changes committed and merged
  [✓] Documentation complete
  [✓] Validation report generated

Recommended Next Steps:
  1. Monitor external benchmark submissions
  2. Gather variance statistics across platforms
  3. Collect feedback on mock bridge accuracy
  4. Plan Phase H.4.1 enhancements:
     - Larger benchmark datasets
     - Real-world checkpoint validation
     - SRC engine integration
     - Cross-platform reproducibility testing

Future Phases:
  - H.4.1: Enhanced benchmarks with real checkpoints
  - H.4.2: Production readiness (web dashboard, CI/CD)
  - H.4.3: Community engagement (submissions, challenges)
  - H.5: Energy profiling & optimization
